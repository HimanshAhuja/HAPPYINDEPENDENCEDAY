          <h1>British Rule</h1>
          <h3>
            The British Raj (/rɑːdʒ/; from rāj, literally, "rule" in Sanskrit
            and Hindustani) was the rule by the British Crown on the Indian
            subcontinent from 1858 to 1947. The rule is also called Crown rule
            in India, or direct rule in India. The region under British control
            was commonly called India in contemporaneous usage, and included
            areas directly administered by the United Kingdom, which were
            collectively called British India, and areas ruled by indigenous
            rulers, but under British tutelage or paramountcy, called the
            princely states. The region as a whole was never officially referred
            to as the Indian Empire.
            <br />
            <br />
            As "India", it was a founding member of the League of Nations, a
            participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928,
            1932, and 1936, and a founding member of the United Nations in San
            Francisco in 1945.
            <br />
            <br />
            This system of governance was instituted on 28 June 1858, when,
            after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East
            India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen
            Victoria (who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India). It lasted
            until 1947, when it was partitioned into two sovereign dominion
            states: the Dominion of India (later the Republic of India) and the
            Dominion of Pakistan (later the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the
            eastern part of which, still later, became the People's Republic of
            Bangladesh in 1971). At the inception of the Raj in 1858, Lower
            Burma was already a part of British India; Upper Burma was added in
            1886, and the resulting union, Burma (Myanmar), was administered as
            an autonomous province until 1937, when it became a separate British
            colony, gaining its own independence in 1948.

        <h1>Mughal Rule</h1>
        <h3>
          The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526–1530), a Central
          Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur
          (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side, and from
          Genghis Khan on his mother's side. Ousted from his ancestral domains
          in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He
          established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into
          India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces
          occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526.
          The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not
          allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.

          India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),
          is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country,
          the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous
          democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the
          Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast,
          it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and
          Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
          Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives;
          its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand
          and Indonesia.

        <h3>
          India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the
          Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate.
          India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when
          the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana,
          began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its
          south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the
          vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under
          the Eurasian Plate. These dual processes, driven by convection in
          the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the
          Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
          uplift the Himalayas. Immediately south of the emerging
          Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled
          with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic
          Plain. Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies
          the Thar Desert.
